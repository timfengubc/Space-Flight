Grace Days: 1

Infinite Running Space Shooter!

Game Mechanics:

Fly the spaceship through infinite space, shoot down green blocks and fly through/collect rings
to gain points, avoiding the red blocks. Shooting down red blocks will deduct the score.

Collect a blue gem to initiate a 20 second
bonus invincibility where all red blocks become green blocks and you cannot lose.
